Side-Swipe-View-Controller
==========================

This iOS view controller allows you to display three or more table views on one view. Users can switch between the table views by simply scrolling the view from side to side.

There are often times that we want to divide the content of the table view into different sections and show one section a time on the screen so that the user can focus on each part. Scrolling up and down makes the user browse through the table. At the same time, we can make the user scroll from side to side in order to switch between the sections. 

Although this control allows any number of table views to be switched with, we recommend that you limit the number to three. This will make the user able to switch from one section to any other section with only one side swipe. Also, one big feature about this control is that it doesn't limit the number of swipes the user can have. In other words, the user can swipe to the same direction infinitely! And the controller will just loop through all the table views.
